Big O Notation: Big O notation is used to describe the upper limit of an algorithmâ€™s
                running time as the input size increases.
                This is associated with time complexity
                Eg:- O(1), O(n), O(log n), etc

Linear Search
Best case (O(1)): The target element is found at the beginning of the array.
Average case (O(n)): The target is somewhere in the middle of the array.
Worst case (O(n)): The target is at the end or not present in the array.

Binary Search
Best case (O(1)): The target happens to be at the middle index on the first check.
Average case (O(log n)): The algorithm reduce down the target over many iterations.
Worst case (O(log n)): The maximum number of divisions needed to search.

From above analysis we can conclude that binary search is more efficient
when compared with the linear seacrch algo.
Because the average case time complexity of binary search is better than linear search.
